# Climate_QA

Climate_QA is currently under development. The goal is to create a Python package that allows for querying and summarizing major climate change documents. The current focus is on developing a prototype.

## Planned Features

* **Document Processing**: Download and process climate change documents into a suitable format.
* **Semantic Search**: Generate vector embeddings for each document and perform semantic searches against a query.
* **Summarization**: Summarize the search results, with a focus on highlighting changes over time and across reports.
* **Frontend Interface**: Allow users to interact with the search and summarization functionalities through a frontend interface.

## Installation (Planned)

Once complete, you should be able to install the package by cloning the repository and running:

```bash
pip install -e .
```
